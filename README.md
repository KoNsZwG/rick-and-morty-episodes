- **Viewing Episodes**: Navigate through the available episodes of the Rick and Morty series. Each episode is presented with its corresponding details.

- **Tracking Watch Status**: Mark episodes as "watched," "unwatched," or "watching" to keep track of your progress through the series. This feature allows users to easily manage their viewing history and plan their future watchlist.

- **Adding to Favorites**: Save your favorite episodes by adding them to your favorites list. This allows for quick access to episodes you particularly enjoy or wish to revisit.

- **Local Storage Persistence**: The app utilizes local storage to persist user data across sessions. This means that your watch status, favorites, and other preferences are saved locally on your device, ensuring that your selections are retained even after refreshing the page or closing the app.
